Mamba guide to code contributions
=================================

This is just a basic guide to Mamba development. If you came here looking for a guide about how to use Mamba to develop web applications, please, refer to the :doc:`../development/mamba_development_guide`.

Just a few considerations
-------------------------

We assume you have already a `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ account and you know how to use the `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ version control system. If you aren't familiar with git, please refer to the `git documentation <http://git-scm.com/documentation>`_ where you can find all the documentation that you need to start working with git.

Mamba follows the workflow described in this `Git Workflow <https://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html>`_ Document wrote by Benjamin Sandofsky.

You should be familiarized already with Mamba concepts. In particular you should read and understand :doc:`mamba_12_steps`, :doc:`submitting_code` and :doc:`coding_style`.
